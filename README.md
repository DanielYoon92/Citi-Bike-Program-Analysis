Since 2013, the Citi Bike program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Each month, bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike DataLinks to an external site. webpage.

However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have questions about the program, so your first task on the job is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers.

Your task in this assignment is to aggregate the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs and find two unexpected phenomena.


**FINDINGS**

Observing the patterns, it becomes evident that the majority of members utilize the service on weekdays, specifically when commuting to or from their workplaces. The peak hours, namely from 7am to 8am and 5pm to 6pm, witness a significant surge in ridership, nearly doubling the number of riders compared to other times of the day. Additionally, it is worth noting that these peak hours coincide with traditional rush hour periods, reflecting the common practice of members relying on the service for their daily commute.

In addition to the aforementioned observations, it is important to highlight the distinguishing characteristics between members and casual riders. While members predominantly utilize the service during peak hours, particularly when commuting to and from work, the behavior of casual riders exhibits a notable contrast. The number of casual riders gradually grows throughout the day, indicating that their usage patterns are not as tightly tied to specific time slots or commuting needs.

This divergence in behavior suggests that members rely on the service for their daily transportation needs, utilizing it as a convenient and efficient mode of commuting. On the other hand, casual riders may include tourists, occasional users, or individuals running errands, whose usage patterns are more flexible and spread throughout the day.

Understanding this discrepancy between members and casual riders allows for a deeper comprehension of the dynamics at play within the ridership patterns. It highlights the varying motivations and preferences of different user segments and emphasizes the importance of catering to their distinct needs when devising strategies for service improvement and expansion.
