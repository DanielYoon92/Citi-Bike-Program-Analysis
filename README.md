Since 2013, the Citi Bike program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Each month, bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike DataLinks to an external site. webpage.

However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have questions about the program, so your first task on the job is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers.

Your task in this assignment is to aggregate the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs and find two unexpected phenomena.


**FINDINGS**

**1.**
Observing the patterns, it becomes evident that the majority of members utilize the service on weekdays, specifically when commuting to or from their workplaces. The peak hours, namely from 7am to 8am and 5pm to 6pm, witness a significant surge in ridership, nearly doubling the number of riders compared to other times of the day. Additionally, it is worth noting that these peak hours coincide with traditional rush hour periods, reflecting the common practice of members relying on the service for their daily commute.

In addition to the aforementioned observations, it is important to highlight the distinguishing characteristics between members and casual riders. While members predominantly utilize the service during peak hours, particularly when commuting to and from work, the behavior of casual riders exhibits a notable contrast. The number of casual riders gradually grows throughout the day, indicating that their usage patterns are not as tightly tied to specific time slots or commuting needs.

This divergence in behavior suggests that members rely on the service for their daily transportation needs, utilizing it as a convenient and efficient mode of commuting. On the other hand, casual riders may include tourists, occasional users, or individuals running errands, whose usage patterns are more flexible and spread throughout the day.

**2.**
At initial observation, it becomes apparent that classic bikes are more commonly preferred by users compared to electric bikes. However, upon closer analysis and in consideration of bike availability, it is revealed that the ratio between the two types remains relatively consistent. This observation implies that if electric bikes have the potential to generate higher profits, there exists a promising opportunity to introduce a greater number of electric bikes in order to facilitate future expansion.

Careful consideration of the ratio between classic bikes and electric bikes, alongside analyzing their respective profitability, provides valuable insights for future planning and decision-making. By capitalizing on the potential higher demand for electric bikes, the bike-sharing service can optimize its offerings, cater to user preferences, and potentially expand its customer base.
